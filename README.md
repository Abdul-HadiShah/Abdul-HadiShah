## About Me 🚀
🎓 Hi, I’m an ELectrical Engineering student with deep interest in AI/ML and Robotics.
🔨 I have prior experience of developing AI-driven solutions for GPS-denied navigation, autonomous systems, hardware integration for UAVs and robotics, and AI solutions for SaaS applications.
🌱 Currently, I’m exploring how renewable energy solutions like Hydrogen can be integrated into UAVs and other autonomous systems to make them more sustainable and efficient.
👨‍💻 I want to leverage machine learning, deep learning, and data science techniques, to develop advance un-manned systems to proof that hardware becomes limitless when empowered by AI, unlocking potential once thought unimaginable. .

## My Experiences 🙌
# Formula Student Driverless | Formula Student Team

Developed a Vehicle Control Unit to optimize the performance of our Formula Student (FS) team's car. Integrated various sensors and control algorithms to process real-time data and send appropriate output signals during races.
Collaborated closely with a team of brilliant minds to design autonomous systems for precision control and system optimization.

# AI/ML Researcher | GPS-Denied Navigation

Worked on GPS-denied navigation systems for UAVs, utilizing machine learning algorithms such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) along with Computer Vision and sensor fusion.
Developed AI-driven Voice command solution to enhance the autonomy of UAVs in planning and executing complex missions.
